Complete the table below with your results, and then provide your interpretation at the end.

For the table, only use numeric values, and do not add any comments or additional columns,
as the times and speed-ups will be checked by a script that assumes the exact number of columns
as in the table given below.

Note that:

- When calculating the parallel speed-up S, use the time output by the code, which corresponds
  to the parallel calculation and does not include initialising the character array or
  performing the serial check.

- Take as the serial execution time the time output by the code when run with a single process
  (hence the speed-up for 1 process should be 1.0).


No. Process:          Mean time (average of 3 runs)           Parallel speed-up, S:
